This is a project for Udemy course using data provided by Kaggle, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.
The goal is to demonstrate data handling, analysis, and visualization learned throughout the course. 

Here are some questions answered in this report:

1) Who were the passengers on the Titanic?

2) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3) Where did the passengers come from?

4) Who was alone and who was with family?

5) What factors helped some survive the sinking?

... - Did the deck have any effects on the passengers survival rate?
... - Did having a family member increase odds of surviving the crash?
